## Problem Statement

placeholder

## Input and Output

Input: a clean image (e.g. original MNIST image)
Output: a perturbed image (e.g. adversarial MNIST image)

## Deliverables
* [Pretrained models](https://github.com/servantez/CS496_Advanced_DL/tree/master/models) (undefended, adversarial and ensemble trained models)
